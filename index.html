        <p>undocumented, RARE. is a Frank Ocean Stan's best resource for unreleased tracks not included in The Lonny Breaux Collection. The tape was compiled with everything else featuring Lonny Breaux or Frank Ocean in the years spanning 2009 to 2015 including a few features and remixes that you can't purchase anywhere. The best audio has been sourced for each track and each have been tagged with the year they were released online, if not recorded.
          The collection was created as a companion to The Lonny Breaux Collection. So long as you have both, be confident that you’ve got everything that been available online as the release date for this version.</p>
